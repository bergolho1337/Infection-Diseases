# Infection-Diseases

A simple repository where computational models for infection diseases are implemented.

## SIR-Model

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. 

The model consists of three compartments: S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number recovered (or immune) individuals. 

This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella.  

## SIRS-Model

For another class of airborne diseases, for example seasonal influenza, an individualâ€™s immunity may wane over time. 

In this case, the SIRS model is used to allow recovered individuals to return to a susceptible state.
